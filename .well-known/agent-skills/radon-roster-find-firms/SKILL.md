# Find firms on Radon Roster

Use this when someone needs PA DEP-certified radon testers, mitigators and labs. Data is the public listing data from https://radonroster.com/ (official licence records; retrieval dates are in each record). A listing is not an endorsement.

## Options (pick one)

1. **Search API**: `GET https://leads.radonroster.com/api/firms?site=radon&zip=<5-digit ZIP>&service=<code>&limit=10`
   - Location (one is required): `zip`, `city`, `county`.
   - Service codes: `testing` (Radon testing), `mitigation` (Radon mitigation), `lab` (Radon laboratory).
   - CORS is open. Spec: https://radonroster.com/openapi.json
2. **MCP**: streamable HTTP at `https://leads.radonroster.com/mcp?site=radon`, with tools `search_firms`, `get_firm` and `list_areas`.
3. **Static feeds** (no API call): https://radonroster.com/api/index.json lists every county/city feed, for example `https://radonroster.com/api/county/<slug>.json`. https://radonroster.com/api/firms.json has every firm.

## Using results

- Each firm has: `id`, `name`, `certification`, `issuing_agency`, `credentials[]` (number, expiry), `services`, `city`, `state`, `counties`, `cities`, `firm_url`, `quote_url` and, where the site shows it, `google_rating`.
- Area results have `match`: `local` means listed in that area's own section; `nearby` means listed under nearby/other firms.
- Phone and contact details are not in the API. Send people to `firm_url`.
- Mention that credentials should be confirmed with the issuing agency (link in `source.urls`).
- Do not scrape the HTML pages; use the feeds.
